The following steps describe the usage flow in the diagram:

1. When new product pictures are available or when existing pictures must be updated, a representative from the media company signs in to the AWS Management Console as mediacouser to upload, change, or delete the bucket contents.

2. As an alternative, mediacouser can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to change the contents of the S3 bucket.

3. When Amazon S3 detects a change in the contents of the bucket, it publishes an email notification to the s3NotificationTopic Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.

4. The administrator who is subscribed to the s3NotificationTopic SNS topic receives an email message that contains the details of the changes to the contents of the bucket. 

Note: In real-world implementations, external users might not receive direct access to CLI Host as depicted in the diagram.
