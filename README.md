AWS Cloud Labs and Projects Summary

As I am breaking through in cloud computing, I have completed several labs and projects using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop my foundational skills. My hands-on experience includes deploying and managing cloud resources, automating processes, and integrating AWS services. Some of the key areas I explored are:

-AWS EC2: Creating EC2 instances and hosting applications in the environment.
-AWS VPC: Setting up a logically isolated enviroment.
-AWS Lambda: Built and deployed serverless functions to automate simple tasks and respond to events.
-Amazon S3: Set up storage buckets for hosting files, managing objects, and integrating with other AWS services.
-Amazon SNS: Configured notification systems to send alerts and messages based on specific triggers.
-IAM: Practiced setting up users, roles, and permissions for secure access management.
-Basic Automation: Used AWS Lambda with S3 and SNS to build automated workflows, such as sending notifications when new files are uploaded.
-Monitoring: Explored AWS CloudWatch for basic logging and monitoring of resources.
These projects helped me gain practical experience with AWS core services and understand how to connect them to build simple but effective cloud solutions. I am eager to continue learning and working on more advanced projects as I grow my cloud skills.
