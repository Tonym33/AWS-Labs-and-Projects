# AWS Cloud Labs and Projects Summary

As I continue building my expertise in cloud computing, I have completed a series of hands-on labs and projects using Amazon Web Services (AWS). These practical exercises have helped me develop foundational skills in deploying and managing cloud infrastructure, automating processes, and integrating core AWS services to build simple yet effective cloud-based solutions.

## Key Areas of Focus

### 🔹 Amazon EC2
- Created and configured EC2 instances.
- Deployed and hosted web applications in virtual server environments.

### 🔹 Amazon VPC
- Set up logically isolated virtual networks.
- Managed subnets, route tables, and security groups to control traffic flow.

### 🔹 AWS Lambda
- Built and deployed serverless functions.
- Automated event-driven tasks and background processes.

### 🔹 Amazon S3
- Configured storage buckets for file hosting and object management.
- Integrated S3 with other AWS services such as Lambda and SNS.

### 🔹 Amazon SNS
- Created and configured Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics.
- Sent automated email and SMS notifications based on specific triggers.

### 🔹 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Set up IAM users, roles, and permission policies.
- Practiced secure access management and followed best practices.

### 🔹 Basic Automation Projects
- Connected AWS Lambda, S3, and SNS to build automated workflows.
- Example: Sending notifications when new files are uploaded to S3.

### 🔹 Monitoring with CloudWatch
- Used AWS CloudWatch for basic logging and resource monitoring.
- Gained visibility into application and infrastructure performance.

## What I Learned

These labs and projects provided me with:
- A solid foundation in AWS core services.
- Practical skills in cloud resource deployment and automation.
- An understanding of how to connect AWS services to solve real-world problems.

## What's Next

I’m excited to continue learning and working on more advanced projects, including infrastructure as code (IaC), container orchestration (ECS/EKS), CI/CD pipelines, and advanced security configurations.
